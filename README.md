# QHacks2017
Using Leap Motion to interact with any monitor as if it was a touch screen. Works will monitors of all sizes, as long as it fits within the Leap's field of view. Currently implemented three gestures for clicking (one finger), dragging (two fingers) and scrolling (three fingers).

# Usage
Application runs calibration procedure at startup. User must place index finger in a corner and then use a keyPress or mousePress to record the value. This is repeated for all corners of the monitor to ensure accurate tracking. THATS IT!! Simply use your monitor as if it were a touch screen.
